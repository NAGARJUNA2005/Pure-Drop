        At PURE DROP, sustainability lies at the core of our mission. Every
        water vending unit we deploy is designed to reduce single-use plastic
        dependency by promoting eco-friendly refilling practices. Our
        purification systems are powered by energy-efficient mechanisms that
        consume up to 40% less power than traditional dispensers, while ensuring
        the highest standards of hygiene and safety.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-6">
        In collaboration with community partners, we aim to install PURE DROP
        machines across educational institutions, corporate parks, and public
        places, ensuring clean water access for everyone. Our CSR initiative,
        <strong> “Refill India”</strong>, focuses on creating awareness about
        water conservation and reducing environmental waste, one refill at a
        time.
